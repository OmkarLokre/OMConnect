O.M.Connect is a robust cross-platform VPN provider service app built using Flutter, designed to enhance network security and act as a firewall. This app provides users with secure and reliable VPN connectivity through a comprehensive set of features.

The core of O.M.Connect is its integration of 97 VPN servers sourced from VPNGate.net, offering diverse global connectivity options for users. This extensive server network ensures that users can maintain secure and private internet connections from various locations worldwide.
